# Web Browser Automation with Agents 🤖🌐

[[open-in-colab]]

In this notebook, we'll create an **agent-powered web browser automation system**! This system can navigate websites, interact with elements, and extract information automatically.

The agent will be able to:
✅ Navigate to web pages
✅ Click on elements
✅ Search within pages
✅ Handle popups and modals
✅ Take screenshots
✅ Extract information

Let's set up this system step by step.

First, run these lines to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install smolagents selenium helium pillow python-dotenv -q
```

Let's import our required libraries and set up environment variables:

```python
from io import BytesIO
from time import sleep

import helium
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from PIL import Image
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

from smolagents import CodeAgent, tool
from smolagents.agents import ActionStep

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()
```

Now let's create our core browser interaction tools that will allow our agent to navigate and interact with web pages:

```python
@tool
def search_item_ctrl_f(text: str, nth_result: int = 1) -> str:
    """
    Searches for text on the current page via Ctrl + F and jumps to the nth occurrence.
    Args:
        text: The text to search for
        nth_result: Which occurrence to jump to (default: 1)
    """
    elements = driver.find_elements(By.XPATH, f"//*[contains(text(), '{text}')]")
    if nth_result > len(elements):
        raise Exception(f"Match n°{nth_result} not found (only {len(elements)} matches found)")
    result = f"Found {len(elements)} matches for '{text}'."
    elem = elements[nth_result - 1]
    driver.execute_script("arguments[0].scrollIntoView(true);", elem)
    result += f"Focused on element {nth_result} of {len(elements)}"
    return result

@tool
def go_back() -> None:
    """Goes back to previous page."""
    driver.back()

@tool
def close_popups() -> str:
    """
    Closes any visible modal or pop-up on the page. Use this to dismiss pop-up windows!
    This does not work on cookie consent banners.
    """
    webdriver.ActionChains(driver).send_keys(Keys.ESCAPE).perform()
```

Let's set up our browser with Chrome and configure screenshot capabilities:

```python
# Configure Chrome options
chrome_options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
chrome_options.add_argument("--force-device-scale-factor=1")
chrome_options.add_argument("--window-size=1000,1350")
chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-pdf-viewer")
chrome_options.add_argument("--window-position=0,0")

# Initialize the browser
driver = helium.start_chrome(headless=False, options=chrome_options)

# Set up screenshot callback
def save_screenshot(memory_step: ActionStep, agent: CodeAgent) -> None:
    sleep(1.0)  # Let JavaScript animations happen before taking the screenshot
    driver = helium.get_driver()
    current_step = memory_step.step_number
    if driver is not None:
        for previous_memory_step in agent.memory.steps:  # Remove previous screenshots for lean processing
            if isinstance(previous_memory_step, ActionStep) and previous_memory_step.step_number <= current_step - 2:
                previous_memory_step.observations_images = None
        png_bytes = driver.get_screenshot_as_png()
        image = Image.open(BytesIO(png_bytes))
        print(f"Captured a browser screenshot: {image.size} pixels")
        memory_step.observations_images = [image.copy()]  # Create a copy to ensure it persists

    # Update observations with current URL
    url_info = f"Current url: {driver.current_url}"
    memory_step.observations = (
        url_info if memory_step.observations is None else memory_step.observations + "\n" + url_info
    )
```

Now let's create our web automation agent:

```python
# Initialize the model
model_id = "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"  # You can change this to your preferred model
model = HfApiModel(model_id)

# Create the agent
agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[go_back, close_popups, search_item_ctrl_f],
    model=model,
    additional_authorized_imports=["helium"],
    step_callbacks=[save_screenshot],
    max_steps=20,
    verbosity_level=2,
)

# Import helium for the agent
agent.python_executor("from helium import *", agent.state)
```

The agent needs instructions on how to use Helium for web automation. Here are the instructions we'll provide:

```python
helium_instructions = """
You can use helium to access websites. Don't bother about the helium driver, it's already managed.
We've already ran "from helium import *"
Then you can go to pages!
Code:
```py
go_to('github.com/trending')
```<end_code>

You can directly click clickable elements by inputting the text that appears on them.
Code:
```py
click("Top products")
```<end_code>

If it's a link:
Code:
```py
click(Link("Top products"))
```<end_code>

If you try to interact with an element and it's not found, you'll get a LookupError.
In general stop your action after each button click to see what happens on your screenshot.
Never try to login in a page.

To scroll up or down, use scroll_down or scroll_up with as an argument the number of pixels to scroll from.
Code:
```py
scroll_down(num_pixels=1200) # This will scroll one viewport down
```<end_code>

When you have pop-ups with a cross icon to close, don't try to click the close icon by finding its element or targeting an 'X' element (this most often fails).
Just use your built-in tool `close_popups` to close them:
Code:
```py
close_popups()
```<end_code>

You can use .exists() to check for the existence of an element. For example:
Code:
```py
if Text('Accept cookies?').exists():
    click('I accept')
```<end_code>
"""
```

Now we can run our agent with a task! Let's try finding information on Wikipedia:

```python
search_request = """
Please navigate to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago and give me a sentence containing the word "1992" that mentions a construction accident.
"""

agent_output = agent.run(search_request + helium_instructions)
print("Final output:")
print(agent_output)
```

You can run different tasks by modifying the request. For example, here's for me to know if I should work harder:

```python
github_request = """
I'm trying to find how hard I have to work to get a repo in github.com/trending.
Can you navigate to the profile for the top author of the top trending repo, and give me their total number of commits over the last year?
"""

agent_output = agent.run(github_request + helium_instructions)
print("Final output:")
print(agent_output)
```

The system is particularly effective for tasks like:
- Data extraction from websites
- Web research automation
- UI testing and verification
- Content monitoring

Best Practices:
1. Always provide clear, specific instructions
2. Use the screenshot callback for debugging
3. Handle errors gracefully
4. Clean up old screenshots to manage memory
5. Set reasonable step limits for your tasks
