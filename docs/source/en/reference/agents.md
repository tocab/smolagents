# Agents

<Tip warning={true}>

Smolagents is an experimental API which is subject to change at any time. Results returned by the agents
can vary as the APIs or underlying models are prone to change.

</Tip>

To learn more about agents and tools make sure to read the [introductory guide](../index). This page
contains the API docs for the underlying classes.

## Agents

Our agents inherit from [`MultiStepAgent`], which means they can act in multiple steps, each step consisting of one thought, then one tool call and execution. Read more in [this conceptual guide](../conceptual_guides/react).

We provide two types of agents, based on the main [`Agent`] class.
  - [`CodeAgent`] is the default agent, it writes its tool calls in Python code.
  - [`ToolCallingAgent`] writes its tool calls in JSON.

Both require arguments `model` and list of tools `tools` at initialization.
